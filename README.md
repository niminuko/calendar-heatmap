# Calendar Heatmap

This README.md is obviously a work-in-progress, but the idea of this repository is to take some region (Houston, Texas for example) and create a graph which shows the temperature throughout the year. It's completed for the most part, but the color of the graphs need to be standardized so that created graphs may be compared to one another meaningfully (as of right now, the color scale will change from region-to-region depending on their average temperatures, which isn't *too* helpful). For single regions, the repository works just fine.
